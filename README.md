# Matlab-App_Design
I create simple app using Matlab features of Stateflow and App Designer. 
Stateflow enables you to design and develop supervisory control, task scheduling, fault management, communication protocols, user interfaces, and hybrid systems.
App Designer lets you create professional apps without having to be a professional software developer. Drag and drop visual components to lay out the design of your graphical user interface (GUI) and use the integrated editor to quickly program its behavior.
